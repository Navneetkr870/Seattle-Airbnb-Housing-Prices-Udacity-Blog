# AirBnB project

### Installations:
The project has been done in the Anaconda enviroment with python 3.6
No packages outside anaconda is nescessary.


### Motivation:
I have been an Airbnb user for a long time and thus when Udacity provided a challenge to write a blog post, I tried to see that data from an analyst's perspective. 

I was curious about how we could use data science techniques to find interesting trends in Airbnb data.

I am interested in answering these questions during this project :
- How the best price is achieved on Airbnb ?
- How good reviews are achieved?
- Is it possible to make an accurate predictive model for listing price based on machine learning?

### Summary
I found that the main driver for prices are how many people a listing can accommodate. Location is also very important aswell as aminities
such as TV, parking, Internet and air condition.

In order to get good reviews it vital to respond to every inquiry and dont have limitations on maximum nights. those who list many appartments gets worse reviews than thos who only list their own. Amenities are also important for good reviews.

I also found that a Random Forest algorithm can predict AirBnB prices with an accuracy of 80%. I belive alot of the remaining variance in the price can be explained by the listings standard which is not a feature in the dataset.


### Files:
The project contains a Jupyter notebook where all the technical sides of the project has been conducted,
A blogpost on Medium --> https://medium.com/@krnavneet870/airbnb-seattle-data-investigation-94b46a9a317
A folder with the raw data and this readme file.


### How to interact with this project.
I advice to read the blogpost first in order to get an overview and the essential. If you want to replicate or read the technical part of the project you can read through the jupyter notebook and interact with it if you want. The raw data is in the folder called "seattle"

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
The project has been comnpleted by myself but few inspiration from a community contributor Roald Brønstad.
